Our History

Hire Llama was started by 2 NYC Co-Founders who tried to outsourcing their product development. Long story short, outsourcing the engineering team did not work. We decided to stop using contracts
and build our own team in LATAM, specifically Quito, Ecuador.



Our Founders

<b>Calvin Smith</b>

As the CEO & Co-founder of Llama Tech, I am globalizing employment by finding talented mid-senior developers in Ecuador and matching them with companies in the US. We are also making a concerted effort to create training programs for entry-level customer service & sales roles for people in Ecuador.

No more buffering - create, style and enjoy. Our user interface was built on React, the most efficient JavaScript library.
